            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſidering it is the cuſtome of thoſe which ſet out Bookes, to ſtamp them with the glorious titles of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of note and authority, that they may bee received as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb facs="tcp:14720:3"/>money; I have given to this little booke the ſilver wings of your right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name, that flying abroad like a mourning Dove, it may finde a quiet resting-place in the favourable allowance of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The matter wherewith it is ſtuffed, is weeping &amp; laughing, mourning and comforts. The end wherefore it is made, is to exhort all kinde of perſons to ſhead teares of godly ſorrow, which God may put in his bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, &amp; the Lamb of God turne into the wine of heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, when they ſhall be called unto his marriage-Supper.</p>
            <p>Such teares were never more neceſſary; I will not ſay that they were never leſſe heeded nor cared for, than they are
<pb facs="tcp:14720:3"/>now, becauſe I am a ſtranger at home: let every man ſpeake to his owne conſcience; let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very conſcience aske of its own heart, how it is touched with ſinne, how affected with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the Church: let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart iudge it ſelfe; and if our heart condemne us, let us all know, that God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>One thing I know general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that men when they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to weep, are accuſtomed to ſay, that weeping is more womaniſh than manly: for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of a more weake and moyst conſtitution of body, and more ſenſible of the paſsions which provoke weeping, than men are. Men blaſpheme the glorious and dreadfull Name
<pb facs="tcp:14720:4"/>of the Lord our God: Men are more frequent in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes, than in the Church: Men let flye all they have at Cards, at Dyce, at other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful games, &amp; fooliſh ſports. Where is there deceit, where robberie, where oppreſsion? where, but among men? Who trouble the ſtate? Men. Who undermine, who betray, who diſmember the Church by ſchiſmes, by hereſies, by ſecret plots? Men. Who perſecute the Church? Men. Who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it? Men. The moſt part of the evill that is done in the world, is done by men: Not becauſe they are moe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are worſe than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and (for the moſt part, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!) have neither wit nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but to doe ill. For all this
<pb facs="tcp:14720:4"/>they weepe not, becauſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, it becomes not men to weepe. But when the hand of God is heavie upon them, will they not curſe? will they not roare like wild beaſts? Is roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more manly? Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo womaniſh as weeping?</p>
            <p>I know not what they call womaniſh? for many women have beene, many in this laſt age of the world are better than manie men. Had not SEMIRAMIS diſtaffe a ſharper edge than NI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS her husbands ſword? Was not TAMYRIS as martiall as CYRVS? did ſhe not find out a more wittie ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem to overthrow him, who was a moſt craftie and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning warrier, and his armie of two hundred thouſand men
<pb facs="tcp:14720:5"/>trained up in warres from the cradle, than he did to intangle her Sonne who was a beardleſſe Captain? did not the AMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZONES fight, when men fled? did they not ſubdue their enemies, who had overcome their husbands? Had not ZENOBIA a lions heart in a womans breaſt? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did ſhee conſtraine the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane armies to ſhew her a faire paire of heeles? Neither was ſhe overcome, but wearied with the innumerable multitude of new armies ſent againſt her by the Emperor VALERIVS AVRELIANNS; who when he had triumphed of her, was faine to be a ſuitor unto her, for her daughter to be his wife. Though ſhe was a Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſhee ſpake Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;
<pb facs="tcp:14720:5"/>ſhee was instructed in all ſciences; ſhe writ the Story of the Orient; ſhe had quick eyes, and a mans voyce; her teeth were ſo white, that ſhe ſeemed to have pearles, and not teeth in her mouth: in all the gifts of the body and of the ſpirit, ſhe went beyond all the men of her age. Her owne husband ODENATVS vvas the most valiant man of thoſe dayes: He ſubdued all the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient, &amp; the Emperor GAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIENVS was fain to pray him to be partaker of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with him: but ſhee was better than he. PHILE was ſo wiſe from her tender nayles, that being yet a yong girle, her father ANTIPATER, that old and wiſe Counſellor of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEXANDER<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> THE
<pb facs="tcp:14720:6"/>GREAT, that worthy King of Macedonia asked her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, and followed it: &amp; when ſhe was wife to DEMETRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VS, a man given to many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhe could manage and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne his paſſions with ſuch diſcretion, that ſhe made his government tolerable to his ſubiects, his perſon reſpectable to all men, his power fearefull to his enemies. I forbeare to ſpeake of CRATESICLEA, the royall mother of CLEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENES king of Sparte, and of PORCIA the wiſe daughter of CATO, and the courageous wife of BRV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS, who, when ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great wound, did not ſo much as ſhrinke.</p>
            <p>To enter into the Church; Was not DEBORAH
<pb facs="tcp:14720:6"/>more meete to bee Generall of an army, than BARAK? did not IAHEL, with a hammer and a nail, teach the great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine SISERA, that he had a fooliſh head? One woman in the Citie of ABEL was wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than all the men therein. There was no man in BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THVLIA to be compared in wiſdome with IVDITH: What courage ſhee and her hand-maid had, OLOFER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES proud and cup-ſhotten head could beſt tell. When IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAS betrayed Chriſt, when PETER denyed him, when the Prieſts and Elders of the Iewes accuſed him, women were faithfull unto him: When <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> condemned him, when men mocked him, and nailed him on the croſſe, women wept
<pb facs="tcp:14720:7"/>for him: when his owne diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples through feare fled away from him, women moſt coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly followed him.</p>
            <p>PVLCHERIA faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but more wiſe than faire, was more worthie of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall diadem, than her brother THEODOSIVS II. who proſpered when hee was guided by her; was unfortunate, and turned the empire topſie turvie when he neglected her counſell. FERDINAND king of Spaine was a wiſe and valiant Prince: But his roiall wife I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SABELLA outreached him in all princely vertues. He was hard and ſparing; She was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and honourable. He was fitter to keep and maintain his own kingdom, than to enlarge it: She, She I ſal, encreaſed it
<pb facs="tcp:14720:7"/>with the kingdome of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, with the Canarie Iſles, and with the new world, which we call AMERICA. She ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drank wine. When ſhe was ſicke, when ſhe was in travaile, not onely ſhee cried not, ſhee mourned not, but ſhee did not ſo much as change her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as give one ſigh. On her daughters wedding day, newes being brought unto her of the death of her only ſonne, ſhee ſuppreſſeth her griefe, ſhe keepes a merrie countenance, leſt ſhe ſhould marre the feaſt MARIVS himſelfe could not have ſhewen a greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>I could name women yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who went ſtoutely to the ſkirmiſh againſt the enemies, no wayes dreading the gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:14720:8"/>of ſwords, the brandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpeares, the hail of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets falling thicke, and whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about their eares. When men made head to men with their heeles, they ran to the breach, and catching the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans that fleeing men had flung away, laid their enemies heads where their feete were, and ſaved the beleaguered towne. The only ſonnes of ſome of them being killed in that cauſe, they buried them vvith dry eyes and laughing faces; calling themſelves happy, that God had made them mothers of ſuch children. Neyther did they at any time weepe, but when they ſaw men doe many things unbeſeeming, not onely Chriſtians, but men: then, through great diſpleaſure, they
<pb facs="tcp:14720:8"/>wept, becauſe men did neither bluſh for ſhame, nor waxe pale for feare of eternall diſgrace, nor weepe for forrow, that, like IVDAS, they had betrayed Ieſus Chriſt; or like REV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEN abode among the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, to heare the bleatings of the flockes.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the principall paſſions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> provoke weeping, are love, anger, ſorrow: If thoſe paſsions bee more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in women, than in men, as men ſay; then, when they are ſanctified in women, as they are in all true Christian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we muſt confeſſe, that in women there is greater anger againſt ſinne, greater ſorrow for ſinne, and for the affliction of the Church, greater love of God, greater zeale of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:14720:9"/>than men: and therefore that women weepe more than men.</p>
            <p>Are they first in weeping? they ſhall be firſt in comforts. The more bitter their weeping is, the greater ſhall their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort be. Women, not men, wept publiquely at the death of Chriſt: therefore they vvere firſt comforted vvith the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome ſight of his glorious reſurrection, and with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given unto them, to bee the Apoſtles of the Apoſtles, and to preach that their Lord and Maſter was riſen againe. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that women are the weaker veſſell. That ſpeech may be turned to their praiſe: for as a little cup of cryſtall, though it be frayle and brittle, is of more value than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb facs="tcp:14720:9"/>bowles of varniſhed tin; ſo one godly and vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is more to bee eſteemed, when ſhe weepeth to God in time of miſery, than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand brutall men, vvho can roare, but cannot weepe.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake of brutall men; for we finde in the Scriptures, and I ſhew in this booke, that the moſt courageous, wiſe, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, that ever had eyes in their heads, did make of their heads living fountaines of tears, of their eyes pipes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them to their cheekes; and did weepe as much, not only as women, but as little children. And indeed are vve not all Gods children? why then ſhall we not weepe, when vve offend him, and hee chaſteneth us? Are vve not in his Church as
<pb facs="tcp:14720:10"/>new borne babes? vvhy then ſhould we not weepe in our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, till hee take us in his lap, lay our mouthes to his breaſt, &amp; ſtill us with the ſweet milke of his ſpiritual comforts? Can man have a true feeling of his evils, and not weep? Can he know that his helpe is in the Name of the Lord, vvho made heaven and earth, and not run unto him, and cry unto him, as the woman of Canaan did, LORD HELP ME?</p>
            <p>Will ſuch men need rules of weeping, &amp; Maſters or Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to teach them how they ought to weepe? No, no: their unfained love to the Church of God, their earneſt affection to the glory of God, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame and godly ſorrow for the bruiſing and cruſhing of

               <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> their paſsionate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and grudge againſt ſinne, will be to them a moſt ſufficient and learned Maſter in that Art. Godly ſorrow will be <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> rodde to their hearts of rocke, and make them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drainable ſpring of ſighes, of groans, of cryes, of tears, of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, of complaints, of expoſtulations, of deprecations. Their fervent love will make them most eloquent in devoute praying. The heart wounded to the quicke, ſendeth up to the eyes rivers of teares, and to the mouth flouds of most pithy and ſignifying words, and eaſeth it ſelfe by weeping and praying. There all the Saints of God, men and women, have in all times found teares enow, and words in aboundance, to make
<pb facs="tcp:14720:11"/>their mone to God.</p>
            <p>Not that God, vvho ſeeth without eyes, &amp; heareth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eares, and before whom hell it ſelfe is naked, and the deepe hath no covering, hath need of our teares to know our wants: but becauſe vve ſtand in need of him, he will have us to know &amp; to feel our own miſeries, and to acknowledge with ſighing, mourning, and praying, that we have no hope but in his helpe, but in the exceeding riches of his grace, but in the infinite treaſures of his mercies. For this cauſe, doth he exhort us to fast, to weepe, and to pray: for the ſame cauſe, at a Faſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized thoſe dayes by-paſt, made I in ſubſtance, and ſo far as two houres of time would permit, and I thought fit for
<pb facs="tcp:14720:11"/>the time and the hearers, this exhortation to weeping; which now I preſent to you,</p>
            <p>MADAM, as a publick teſtimonie of the due account which I make of thoſe excellent gifts, both of nature and of grace, vvherewith God hath, with an open hand, inriched your noble and honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. ISABELLA the Queen of women, of whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken, might have been called the PHOENIX of Queenes, if there had not bin a ZENOBIA before her in the Orient, and after her an ELIZABETH in England: This Queene was to all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a gliſtering Mirrour of chaſtitie, a rare example of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, a perfect preſident of modeſty. She could not abide
<pb facs="tcp:14720:12"/>Ieſters, Stage-players, Fidlers, but baniſhed them all off her Court: when ſhee was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with matters of State, ſhe was ever in the middeſt of her Ladies, ſewing with her owne hands, and inſtructing &amp; exhorting them, by word and by example, to godlineſſe and vertue. Every day twice ſhe had her ordinary houres of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayers. Her daughter MARY, Queene of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, like unto her, was very grave in all her carriage, was as milde as any might be to all perſons, was enemy to idleneſſe, and was wont to exhort all her Ladies to MODESTIE; ſaying, that MODESTY IS THE PRINCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAL ORNAMENT OF A WOMAN. The
<pb facs="tcp:14720:12"/>Chaſtitie and Modeſty of a woman; the gracious and courteous gravity of a Lady; the zeale and piety of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; the wiſdome and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t care of a vertuous &amp; noble Matron, are the vertues w<hi>
